  <h1><em>History <br>of<br><strong>Damascus ROSES</strong> </em> </h1>

  <p>
    ‘I come to you ... from the tales of the ­Damascene rose, that depicts the history of all fragrance," wrote famed ­Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani.

    But he was not the first, or the last, writer to be captivated by the bloom. It was a favourite of Shakespeare, who referenced the flower in Twelfth Night, as well as in Sonnet 130 ("I have seen roses damask'd, red and white"), and of English
    poet Thomas Rivers, whose ode The Damask Rose captures the famously dense and fragrant nature of the bloom. “High, high, above your head, and on every side down to the ground, the thicket is hemmed in and choked up by the interlacing boughs that
    droop with the weight of roses, and load the slow air with their damask breath,” he wrote.

    Beyond being known for its heady fragrance, the Damask rose has long been used for rose oil or “attar of roses”, and is commonly used to flavour food and make rose water. Beyond that, recent research on Rosa damascena essential oil has
    highlighted its anti­oxidant, antibacterial and anti­microbial activities. The deciduous shrub can grow to more than two metres tall, with 30-petalled flowers that can range in colour from light pink to light red. It is repeat flowering, making
    it particularly popular with the perfume industry. “Two of the varieties of the damask rose are repeat flowering,” explains Ian ­Limmer, nursery manager for Peter Beales, a Norfolk-based rose specialist. “It's also a very tough rose, making it
    perfect for the perfume industry … it means that they can have an extraction in June, and then chop it down and get another extraction in September.”

    A natural hybrid of Rosa gallica with Rosa moschata and Rosa fedtschenkoana, there’s some debate as to whether the flower actually originated in Damascus, but crusader ­Robert de Brie is believed to have brought the flower to Europe from Syria
    in the 13th century.The Damask rose was introduced officially in Europe during the XIII century, brought from Persia; but was probably in Europe before that, since it shows up in ancient Roman frescoes, specifically the Autumn Damask rose. R. damascena can be found nowadays in the wild around Morocco, Andalusia, the Middle East and the Caucasus.

  <p>These roses are shrubs and are also included on what is referred as old garden roses (OGR), Heritage or Antiques. Damasks are related to gallicas. Summer damasks are crosses between gallicas and R. phoenicea and autumn damasks between Gallicas and R. moschata.

These varieties are very resistant, vigorous and robust, with vicious thorns. Develop into large and tall plants, mostly growing to around 4ft x 36 in / 1.2m x 90cm. Use a damask in the garden as a feature, by itself or in mixed borders and beds.

  Damask roses require minimal care and are easy to grow. They tolerate any type of soil, except chalk. Give them some general fertilizer in spring and rose food in mid-summer and cover the soil at their bottom with organic mulch and they will be happy. Some pruning should be done in late winter or early spring. Just cut out the weak or diseased stems and enough just to establish a good plant shape. Do cut dead heads in late summer also.
